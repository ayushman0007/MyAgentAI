# Insurance Claims Charges Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting insurance claims charges based on various features in the dataset. The pipeline involves data analysis, preprocessing, and evaluating the performance of multiple machine learning models.

## Workflow
### STEP-1: Importing Libraries & Dataset
- Import all necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and machine learning libraries like `sklearn`.
- Load the insurance dataset into a DataFrame for further analysis.

### STEP-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset and its features.
- Visualize relationships and trends using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- Identify outliers and patterns in the data.

### STEP-3: Data Preprocessing / Cleaning the Data
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale numerical features for better model performance.
- Generate a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

### STEP-4: Fit the Model, Predict, and Check Accuracy
- Train and evaluate the following models for prediction:
  - Linear Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Use appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.
- Compare the results of different models and select the best-performing one.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

To install the necessary libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Results
- The project compares the performance of four machine learning models for insurance claims charges prediction.
- The best model is chosen based on evaluation metrics.

## Notes
- Ensure the dataset file (`dataset.csv`) is present in the same directory as the notebook.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
- Visualize model predictions to better understand how the models perform on the dataset.
